## Requirements
* tensorflow-gpu 1.8
* hadoop-2.9.0
* spark-2.3.0

## Todo
* install script

## Done
* single mode tensorflow to HDFS pipeline setup

### Conditions of use of the images
1. Please include a reference to these Bioinformatics and Nature Methods papers in any publication resulting from the use of any of these datasets.
1. The fact that you have registered for the challenge does not oblige you in any way to submit results. Your registration is considered as an expression of interest to participate and allows you to download the datasets and submit results.
1. Ideally, we would like to encourage all participants to submit results for all datasets to get a complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of all algorithms under different scenarios. However, given the varying nature of the datasets (nuclei or cells, different cell types, 2D or 3D, noise level and general image quality) and microscopy modalities (fluorescence, phase contrast, DIC) you can also submit results for only certain datasets, or submit more than one algorithm, each one targeting one or several specific datasets.
1. All participating teams wishing to be included in the challenge report and in any future publication, will be required to provide a working version of the algorithm used to produce the submitted results, either in the form of an executable or compilable source code. The challenge committee reserves the right to proceed to random tests to verify submitted results by rerunning the algorithms on the challenge datasets. The provided software will not be released publicly if participants do not agree with that. It will be used only for verification purposes.
1. To encourage the participation of groups that may be discouraged by the public display of potentially poor results, the rankings will display only the names of the top-three ranked participants for each dataset. The other lower ranked algorithms will not be listed, but the participants will be informed about the absolute performance of their algorithms.
